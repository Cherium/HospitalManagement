This build contains a library, and as such it needs to be imported into your project (preferably as a relative path instead of an absolute)

-1. Uninstall everything Java. Find and delete your Eclipse folder. Find and Delete your workspace folder. Find and delete your hidden '.p2' folder which is in the same folder as the others. Restart your system.
	

0. Ensure you have the latest JDK (version 14 as of writing this: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
	Once installed, set up your PATH(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1672281/environment-variables-for-java-installation/26640589#26640589) 
	HOWEVER, make sure you are using the correct jdk version for the name, instead of those older versions.
	To test, open up a terminal. and check `java -version` and `javac -version` to make sure those commands work, and that the version is the latesest.
		If not, then you need to set up your path properly.
	
1.Install the latest Eclipse IDE(https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/). Open Eclipse now and choose a new workspace and create a new project.
